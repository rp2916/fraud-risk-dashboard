# Fraud Risk Detection & Monitoring Dashboard

This project demonstrates how machine learning and analytics can be used to detect high-risk financial transactions and support AML / fraud investigation teams.

## What this does
- Trains a fraud-detection model on real European transaction data
- Optimises decision thresholds to balance false positives and missed fraud
- Provides a real-time monitoring dashboard (Streamlit + Plotly)

## Business value
- Identifies suspicious transactions early
- Reduces unnecessary investigations
- Improves precision of AML & fraud teams

## How it works
1. Data is downloaded and processed in Python  
2. A machine-learning model generates risk scores  
3. Dashboards show risk distribution, model performance and investigation workload  

## Tech stack
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Plotly, Streamlit

## Dashboard
Screenshots in the `charts/` folder show the live monitoring views.
